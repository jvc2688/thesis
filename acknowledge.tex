First and foremost, I would like to thank my advisor David Hogg.
It is David who led me to the PhD study and astronomical research.
I am extremely grateful for his patience, encouragement, and thoughtful mentoring during these years.
I would never have made it here without his guidance.

This dissertation and my graduate school career would not have been possible without the help of my collaborators.
I am deeply grateful to Daniel Foreman-Mackey, Bernhard Sch\"olkopf, David Schiminovich and Steven Mohammed for their insightful discussion, mentoring, encouragement, and support.

I am grateful to the fantastic computational support that I received at NYU, especially Shenglong Wang for his persistent 24/7 support.

I would also like to thank my other dissertation readers, David Schiminovich and Jeremy Tinker for taking the time to read my thesis and provide useful suggestions.

I would like to thank my classmates at NYU and friends in NYC:
Minzhi, Yiyang, Xingchen, Fang-Yi, Di, Zhongxu, Hongjian, Wale, Jeev, Mohammadjavad, Ben and many others.
Their friendships made my graduate school experience truly enjoyable.

Finally, I would like to thank my family---
my parents Zhihua Wang and Weiqin Zhu, 
my wife Danqing Sun, 
and most importantly my grandmother Meifeng Xue
for their continued, love, encouragement, and support.
Without them, I would not be where I am today.
