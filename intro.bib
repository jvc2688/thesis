@article{gPhoton,
	Abstract = {gPhoton is a new database product and software package that enables analysis of GALEX ultraviolet data at the photon level. The project's stand-alone, pure-Python calibration pipeline reproduces the functionality of the original mission pipeline to reduce raw spacecraft data to lists of time-tagged, sky-projected photons, which are then hosted in a publicly available database by the Mikulski Archive at Space Telescope. This database contains approximately 130 terabytes of data describing approximately 1.1 trillion sky-projected events with a timestamp resolution of five milliseconds. A handful of Python and command-line modules serve as a front end to interact with the database and to generate calibrated light curves and images from the photon-level data at user-defined temporal and spatial scales. The gPhoton software and source code are in active development and publicly available under a permissive license. We describe the motivation, design, and implementation of the calibration pipeline, database, and tools, with emphasis on divergence from prior work, as well as challenges created by the large data volume. We summarize the astrometric and photometric performance of gPhoton relative to the original mission pipeline. For a brief example of short time-domain science capabilities enabled by gPhoton, we show new flares from the known M-dwarf flare star CR Draconis. The gPhoton software has permanent object identifiers with the ASCL (ascl:1603.004) and DOI (doi:10.17909/T9CC7G). This paper describes the software as of version v1.27.2.},

	Abstract = {Photometry of stars from the K2 extension of NASA's Kepler mission is afflicted by systematic effects caused by small (few-pixel) drifts in the telescope pointing and other spacecraft issues. We present a method for searching K2 light curves for evidence of exoplanets by simultaneously fitting for these systematics and the transit signals of interest. This method is more computationally expensive than standard search algorithms but we demonstrate that it can be efficiently implemented and used to discover transit signals. We apply this method to the full Campaign 1 data set and report a list of 36 planet candidates transiting 31 stars, along with an analysis of the pipeline performance and detection efficiency based on artificial signal injections and recoveries. For all planet candidates, we present posterior distributions on the properties of each system based strictly on the transit observables.},

	Abstract = {K2 's Campaign 9 ( K2 C9) will conduct a ∼3.7 deg 2 survey toward the Galactic bulge from 2016 April 22 through July 2 that will leverage the spatial separation between K2 and the Earth to facilitate measurement of the microlens parallax ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1538-3873/128/970/124401/paspaa340eieqn1.gif] {${\pi }_{{\rm{E}}}$} for ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1538-3873/128/970/124401/paspaa340eieqn2.gif] {$\gtrsim 170$} microlensing events. These will include several that are planetary in nature as well as many short-timescale microlensing events, which are potentially indicative of free-floating planets (FFPs). These satellite parallax measurements will in turn allow for the direct measurement of the masses of and distances to the lensing systems. In this article we provide an overview of the K2 C9 space- and ground-based microlensing survey. Specifically, we detail the demographic questions that can be addressed by this program, including the frequency of FFPs and the Galactic distribution of exoplanets, the observational parameters of K2 C9, and the array of resources dedicated to concurrent observations. Finally, we outline the avenues through which the larger community can become involved, and generally encourage participation in K2 C9, which constitutes an important pathfinding mission and community exercise in anticipation of WFIRST .},

	Abstract = {We present the microlensing optical depth toward the Galactic bulge based on the detection of 99 events found in our Difference Image Analysis (DIA) survey. This analysis encompasses 3 yr of data, covering ~17 million stars in ~4 deg 2 , to a source-star baseline magnitude limit of V = 23. The DIA technique improves the quality of photometry in crowded fields, and allows us to detect more microlensing events with faint source stars. We find that this method increases the number of detection events by 85% compared with the standard analysis technique. DIA light curves of the events are presented, and the microlensing fit parameters are given. The total microlensing optical depth is estimated to be τ total = 2.43 ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/541/2/734/img1.gif] {img1.gif} × 10 -6 , averaged over eight fields centered at l = 2 ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/fdg.gif] {fdg} 68 and b = -3 ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/fdg.gif] {fdg} 35. For the bulge component, we find τ bulge = 3.23 ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/541/2/734/img2.gif] {img2.gif} × 10 -6 , assuming a 25% stellar contribution from disk sources. These optical depths are in good agreement with the past determinations of the MACHO and OGLE groups, and are higher than predicted by contemporary Galactic models. We show that our observed event timescale distribution is consistent with the distribution expected from normal mass stars, if we adopt the Scalo stellar mass function as our lens mass function. However, we note that since there is still disagreement about the exact form of the stellar mass function, there is uncertainty in this conclusion. Based on our event timescale distribution, we find no evidence for the existence of a large population of brown dwarfs in the direction of the Galactic bulge.},
